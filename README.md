# PaymentProcessing
Features the use of the Stripe SDK's Charge object to process transactions. Written mostly in Java for Android.

Take care to insert the credentials relative to your own Stripe merchant account i.e. your pk value.
You will also need a baseURL to validate the transactions from the app.
Also, the server-side code can be found in the index.js (you will need the sk value from the Stripe account) of my PayPayment-ServerCode repo.
